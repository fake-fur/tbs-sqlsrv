SQL Server data plugin for TinyButStrong

This is just a small data reader/writer plugin for the Tinybutstrong PHP template engine that allows it to access SQL Server as a data source from PHP versions 5.4+. It also contains some useful (to me) utility functions for querying and updating the database from your code. Feel free to ignore those functions as you please.

I put this up here on Github just so it is in a central place and doesn't depend on me doing anything to it going forward, although I will update it as required. I'm also more than happy for others to improve my (probably) not so good code and documentation.

:)
